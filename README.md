# Automated Git Committer

This repository contains a Node.js script that automates the process of making random commits to a specified file in a Git repository. The script uses `simple-git` for Git operations and `moment` for date manipulation.

## Features

- Randomly generates commit dates within the past year.
- Writes the generated date to a specified file.
- Commits the changes with the generated date.
- Repeats the process for a specified number of commits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/reblox01/automated-git-committer.git
   cd automated-git-committer
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. If not already initialized, initialize a local Git repository and link it to your remote repository:
   ```sh
   # Delete old .git if already exist and create another one
   git init

   # Link your repository with your local prj
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/automated-git-committer.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.js` file and adjust the `FILE_PATH` constant if necessary.

2. Run the script with Node.js:

    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```
    Or
    
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Configuration

* The number of commits to make can be adjusted by changing the argument passed to the `makeCommit` function at the bottom of the `index.js` file. For example, `makeCommit(10)` will make 10 commits.
